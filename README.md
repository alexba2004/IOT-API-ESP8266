# IOT-API-ESP8266

Welcome to IOT-API-ESP8266! This repository hosts a project aimed at creating an API using EJS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB. The primary functionality involves gathering data from the temperature/humidity sensor of an ESP8266 WIFI module and presenting it in a user-friendly table styled with Bootstrap. The project emphasizes the use of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, providing a structured and maintainable architecture.

## Dependencies

Ensure that the following dependencies are installed before proceeding:

- Node.js
- Express: ^4.18.2
- EJS: ^3.1.9
- Mongoose: ^7.6.3
- Chalk: ^4.1.0
- Nodemon: ^3.0.1

## Project Overview

This project extends beyond its technical components. It seeks to bridge the gap between hardware and software by integrating an ESP8266 WIFI module, a versatile and widely used IoT device. The sensor data collected, such as temperature and humidity, is processed through a robust Node.js backend, with MongoDB serving as the database for efficient data storage and retrieval. The Bootstrap-styled table provides an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface for users to easily interpret and analyze the sensor readings.

## Directory Structure

The project adheres to the MVC structure:

- **Model:** Definitions and interactions with the MongoDB database reside in the `models` folder.
- **View:** EJS views are stored in the `views` folder, and the Bootstrap-styled user interface is crafted here.
- **Controller:** Application logic is encapsulated within the `controllers` folder.
